# Machine Learning by Andrew Ng - Implementation in Python
To help python programmers experiment and learn. ***All Machine Learning algorithms are implemented from scratch in jupyter notebook.***

### Prerequisites
1. Knowledge of Numpy, pandas and matplotlib library of python.
   
   You can learn about them from their respective docs - 
   
   Numpy docs - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/quickstart.html
   
   Pandas docs - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/tutorials.html
   
   Matplotlib docs - https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html
   
2. You can use any editor of your choice. But I recommend using ***Jupyter notebook*** as it allows you to
   edit your code snippets and run them again and again, easily shareable and helps in data visualisation.
   
   You can install jupyter notebook along with Anaconda Distribution(https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
   
#### One Friendly Advice 
Play with the code and learn along.
